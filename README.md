# MR to pCT for TUS

This script produces a pseudo-CT image from a T1-weighted MR image for use in acoustic simulations of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS).


## Platform

Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS) and on macOS Catalina (10.15.7).  
Works with both NVIDIA GPU and CPU-only platforms.


## Dependencies

* [MONAI] (https://monai.io/)
* [ANTsPy] (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy)


## Instructions

Install dependencies (see above). 

Clone or download python notebook, utility scripts, trained weights, and example dataset. 

In cell #2 of the python notebook mr-to-pct_infer.ipynb, change the path to point to your input MR image, output pCT image, and the location where you saved the trained network weights:
```
# Set data file paths
input_mr_file = '/Users/sitiyaakub/Documents/Analysis/MRtoCT/ForGitHub/sub-test01_t1w.nii'
output_pct_file = '/Users/sitiyaakub/Documents/Analysis/MRtoCT/ForGitHub/sub-test01_pct.nii'
trained_weights = '/Users/sitiyaakub/Documents/Analysis/MRtoCT/ForGitHub/pretrained_net_final_20220825.pth'
```

You may optionally prepare your T1-weighted MR image. If prep_t1 is set to True, the T1-weighted MR image will be bias corrected (using ANTs N4BiasFieldCorrection) and backgound noise outside the head will be masked out.
```
# Do you want to prepare the t1 image? This will perform bias correction and create a head mask
# yes = True, no = False. Output will be saved to <mr_file>_prep.nii
prep_t1 = True
```

You may also optionally produce an example figure of the pCT output. If plot_mrct is set to True, an example figure will be produced. 
```
# Do you want to produce an example plot? yes = True, no = False. 
plot_mrct = True
```

Run notebook.

This will produce the output pCT image in the specified file path.


## Input to network

The software works best for input T1-weighted MR images with the following specifications:
1) scanner: Siemens Prisma 3T
2) acquisition parameters: acquired in sagittal plane, 2100 ms repetition time (TR), 2.26 ms echo time (TE), 900 ms inversion time (TI), 8Â° flip angle (FA), GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2, and 1 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel size
2) maximum matrix size: 256 x 256 x 256
3) voxel size: 1mm isotropic
4) bias-corrected (e.g. using N4BiasFieldCorrection in ANTs or similar: see https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)
5) noise outside the head masked out

The bias correction and noise masking can be optionally applied within the script by setting `prep_t1 = True`.
